# wizard
A lisp with first class types, designed to be a small, hackable core language
for developing something more ergonomic.

# Current features
* Interpreter (currently implemented in Clojure)
* Core untyped lambda calculus
* Definitions

# In progress features
* Macros (alpha conversion and reading done, still need to do expansion)

# Planned features
Roughly in priority order:
* Currying/Uncurrying + nice funtion def macros
* REPL
* Core simply typed lambda calculus
* Type constructors
* Polymorphism
* Dependent types
* A decent set of primitives, including maps
* Interfaces (aka typeclasses)
* Record types
* Linear/Quantitative types
* Modest prelude
* Compiler (to Rust or Zig)
* Self-hosting(!)
* Modest stdlib
* Package manager
* Autoformatter

# Possible features
* Higher Inductive Types
* Univalence Axiom
